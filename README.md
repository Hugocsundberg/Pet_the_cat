# Pet_the_cat 

This site was made as a school project to create a useless website. (In the theme of https://theuselessweb.com/). 
The web-app is made in native HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Personal focus for the app has been high quality and performance over functionality.

* Images are exclusively SVG to maximize crispness and performance. 
* The app has been tested on Chrome (Desktop), Chrome (Mobile) Brave, Safari (OSX), Safari (IOS). 
* The app is supported on screen-sizes from iPhone 5 (320 x 568)px to infinity and works in both portrait and landscape.  

I've tried to make the code as readable as possible. Any suggestions on how to make the code more readable is greatly appriciated.
